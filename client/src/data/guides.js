        a: 'It depends on the fibre, the weight and the construction, so there is no single answer. Needle punched felts are typically dense and dimensionally stable, which is why they are the usual choice for geotextiles and automotive felt. Tell us the strength or stability your application needs and we will confirm what suits it.',

      {
        q: 'Do these fabrics use glue or chemical binder?',

        q: 'Does Kiran Nonwovens offer both processes?',

      },
      {
        q: 'Which is better for insulation and padding?',
        a: 'Thermal bonded nonwoven is often chosen for lofty, resilient padding and wadding, because heat-set low-melt fibre holds an open, springy structure. Needle punched felt is denser, so it is common where a firmer insulation layer is needed, such as automotive felt. The thickness and density your part needs decide.',

      {
        q: 'Which one is used for geotextile?',
